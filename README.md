# Final-Project

This project involves web scrapping match data from the 2023-2024 Premier League season. This dataset created from web scrapping was then cleaned, visualized, and used to train machines learning models to predict wether the home team won, the away team won, or a draw occurred. These machine learning models were then evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, and AUC score. These metrics indicated that the models performed considerably better than random guessing, however, not to a noticeably impressive level. It was determined that the match stats that are recorded for soccer matches are not indicative of the outcome of a soccer match. This suggests that other stats should be presented to soccer fans to provide more of a complete story of how the match was played.
